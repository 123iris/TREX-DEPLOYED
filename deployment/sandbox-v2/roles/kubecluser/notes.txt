* Checkout mosip/commmons repo on branch MOSIP-257

* To setup a cluster fresh, following instructions here:

https://www.tecmint.com/install-kubernetes-cluster-on-centos-7/

but start kubeadmn before kubelet.   kubeadmn will start kubelet 

* To disable swap,
$ sudo swapoff -a

Comment out the swap line from /etc/fstab (to permanently disable swap)

* Put console ip in /etc/hosts of each node (including master)
192.168.100.1 console

* Set up a local registry on console (localhost) and push kernel-config-server
to that registry which is picked from kernel-config-server POD in kubernets.
TODO: Automate this.  Follow instructions here:

https://docs.docker.com/registry/deploying/

* Add the following to enable http connection to registry instead of https to 
/etc/docker/daemon.json:
{
  "insecure-registries" : ["console:5000"]
}
###

When nodes stop and restart, the following needs to be done on each node:

$ sudo swapoff -a (only if swap still appears) 
$ sudo kubeadm (ignore errors)
