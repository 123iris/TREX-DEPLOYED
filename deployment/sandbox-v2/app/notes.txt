* Ansible version
  ansible 2.9.4

KEYCLOAK
* Admin account:
  username: admin
  password: admin
* Run keycloak: 
  $ docker run -d -e KEYCLOAK_USER=admin -e KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=admin -p 9000:8080 jboss/keycloak
* Keycloak webpage:
* mosip-admin-client (same in properties) needs to exist for user to successfully login in.
  But Role is not necessary for this user.
*  Keycloak
  ^keycloak.* is not needed in properties files - they have to be defined, but ignored.
* Keycloak user account - Remove the condition to "Updated Password" for a user.

* Got the following wait message when tried quering for deployment status:
  $ kubectl rollout status deployment/postgres

  "Waiting for deployment spec update to be observed..."

   Had to restart nodes
* Front end URL needs to be added while installing pod. 

  
* To setup a cluster fresh, following instructions here:
  https://www.tecmint.com/install-kubernetes-cluster-on-centos-7/

  but start kubeadmn before kubelet.   kubeadmn will start kubelet 

* To disable swap,
  $ sudo swapoff -a

  Comment out the swap line from /etc/fstab (to permanently disable swap)

###

When nodes stop and restart, the following needs to be done on each node:

  $ sudo swapoff -a (only if swap still appears) 
  $ sudo kubeadm init (ignore errors, only on Master, not needed on slave) 

* To connect to postgres
  * Get node port using  
   $  kubectl get service postgres

  * Get a worker/slave nodes ip from /etc/hosts of console (any worker node is fine)
   $ psql -h <node ip> -p <node port> -U postgres
   
   password: postgres 

* Postgres DB mosip_iam needs an init to start Kernel Auth Service.

TODO:
- Change all the k8s files to have Image pull policy as "Ifnotpresent"
- Write automation of building and pushing config server docker 
- Pv and PVC are immutable. Script fails while installing them again, so there existence must be checked.
- Automate Keycloak's service account role mapping (client - role mapping)
- The ips used in metallb need to be used for nginx ingress. (link)
- Automate role id update in properties
- Automate nginx setup (conf file)
- Insert the following line in master data valid_documents table (it will be available in 1.0.8)
 insert into valid_document (doctyp_code, doccat_code, lang_code,is_active, cr_by, cr_dtimes) values ('COE', 'POE', 'ara', true, 'superadmin', now());

- Have to restart Kernel auth if OTP is not received.  Needs to be fixed.
- HDFS:  name node runs on port 9000 for this docker.  Inside docker you have to do following:

  for:
   - regprocessor
   - prepreg
   - idrepo

===================

* Keycloak
  * Assign all roles to all clients (just for now). 
  * INDIVIDUAL role's id needs to be copied to kernel-qa.properties

* Masterdata
  * Master db access had to be changed to sysadmin:
```
   masterdata_database_username=sysadmin
   masterdata_database_password=Mosipadm@dev123
```

* Properties:
ApplicantType_Document_Mapping.json - not being used.

## Kubeworker 1
* create /mnt/mosip_data/postgre directory which must be empty.
* Install git
  * sudo yum install git
* For config server
  * create /mnt/mosip_data/config_repo dir.
  * Copy all property files from roles/config-server/files/properties to the above dir
  * git init 
  * git add .
  * git commit
  * CAUTION: An empty space is properties is not removed - be carefully if there is a space after a password string.   



NGINX:
Install
* sudo yum install -y nginx
* sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=http
* sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=https
* sudo firewall-cmd --reload

* Nginx permission problem. On console machine or on which nginx is running disable selinux:
 *  setsebool httpd_can_network_connect on -P


PYTHON3:

Face some issues with python3.  Basically if Ansible interpreter is set to python3 then the same must be available 
on all machines.  However, centos 7 does not have the same enabled by default.  So, you can't use 
Ansible to install python!  Has to be installed with some other scripts or manually. 

If python3 is installed, /bin/yum has to be changed to /usr/bin/python2 on the top as yum runs only on python2

set python interpreter to python2 for yum only

HDFS

Currently hdfs port 9000 has been made nodeport and access of the same has been enabled from DMZ cluster as hdfs://mzworker0:30124. This is a bit as dmz should not be accessing it.  Remove it later.
